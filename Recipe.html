    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 green onion , sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder (or 1/4 teaspoon MSG)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li> 2 teaspoons light soy sauce , or to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li> 110 g (4 oz) dried thin wheat noodles or somen noodles , or 200 g (7 oz) fresh noodles or thin hand-pulled noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 baby bok choy quartered (or vegetable of your choice)</li>
      <li>Homemade soy sauce egg</li>
      <li>Homemade chili oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
       <li>If making two small bowls, divide the green onions evenly between two bowls and add 1/4 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 or 2 teaspoons soy sauce to each bowl (depending on preference and the saltiness of the stock used). Add everything to a big bowl if making 1 serving.</li>
       <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. At the same time bring the chicken stock to a boil and add 1 cup to each bowl. Stir to dissolve the sugar and chicken bouillon powder.</li>
       <li>If adding bok choy or another vegetable blanch them in the boiling water until just cooked through, between 30 seconds to 1 minute, until just cooked through. Distribute the bok choy evenly between the bowls (or if you would like to lay them on top for looks, set them aside and place them on after the noodles are added).</li>
       <li>Boil the noodles according to the instructions on the package, try to get them al dente so they donâ€™t overcook in the broth, usually 1 minute less than indicated on the package.</li>
       <li>Drain the noodles and rinse briefly under cold water to stop the cooking. Add half to each bowl.</li>
       <li>Taste and add more sesame oil or soy sauce if needed. Top with other ingredients if using.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
       <li>Taste the soup first before spicing it up. You might find you donâ€™t actually need the chili oil ðŸ™‚</li>
      </ul>
